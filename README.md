# JGameEngine
 Software Rendering Game Engine written in java
 
 I started this project to create a game engine in java that will allow me to implement and visualize many algorithms. 
 
 JGameEngine can allow developers to create a game that is totally independent to JGameEngine. This way, I allowed total customization of the game engine through a GameManager object. 
 
 Currently I have these projects written using this engine:
[Chess](https://github.com/altarrok/JGE.chess)

[Sorting Algorithm Visualization](https://github.com/altarrok/JGE.sorting)

[Tic-Tac-Toe w/ AI - Minimax & AlphaBeta Pruning Algorithms](https://github.com/altarrok/JGE.tic-tac-toe)
